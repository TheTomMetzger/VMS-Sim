# VMS Sim
Simulates a virtual memory system on Valgrind outputs. Currently supports 2 tested and one partially tested page replacement policies. 

* Fully tested policies:
	* FIFO
	* LFU
* Partially tested policies:
	* LRU	 

<br>

## Demo
Compile with the `DEMO` macro defined. Intended to be run on the evince Valgrind output, tests both the FIFO and LFU policies.

Evince is too large to store on GitHub. The file can be found [here](https://opensource.southernerd.us/college-courses/cos421/evince.val.out) instead.

### This was a school project.<br>No continuation is currently planned.
